# ClassifiedPostHackathon
An app made for the Classified Post Jobs in the Classified Post Hackathon which is an improved way for Job application experience

We have created a unique and interactive application based on the idea of Tinder where a potential employee swips right or left to accept or decline an offer.
Besides the unique idea to ease the application forms we have also tried to add how many people are looking at the same job offer as one particular user is.

The application is built on React Native and Redux and uses the APIs provided by the Classified Post Jobs.

The app maintains all the features of the original CPJobs such as the salary range and the fields to narrow down the search.
